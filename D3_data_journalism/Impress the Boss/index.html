          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Between Poverty and Obesity we can say that the ones whose are obese do live in poverty than that people without obese. 
            Between Poverty and Smokes it seems that people who live in poverty also smoke more than people who do not live in poverty.
            Between Poverty and Lacks Healthcare it exists a correlation, so we can say that people with a low-income are more prone to be 
            uninsured than people with a regular or high-income.</p>

          <p>Between Age and Obesity we can say that from the age of 36-38 people suffers more from obesity in the USA. 
             Between Age and Smokes ooccurs the same as Age and Obesity as well. Between Age and Lacks Healthcare we can see that
             many young people are more likely to be uninsured than older people.</p>

          <p>Between Household Income and Obesity it seems to be correlated that households with a low-income are more likely to be obese than households 
            with a high-income and this is kind of weird for me because if they dont have a relevant income, how could 
            they be able to support all the expenses in food. Between Household Income and Smokes exists a correlation that households with a low-income 
            seem to smoke more than households with a high-income and I think that it could happen beacuse of the stress. Between Household Income and Lacks Healthcare 
            it seems to be correlated with a mild difference in households with a low-income are a more prone to be uninsured than households with a high-income.</p>
